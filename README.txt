Resolved a critical issue involving a SqlException: Connection Timeout Expired, ensuring smoother database operations by addressing connectivity timeouts effectively.
The issue was the methods GetAwaiter().GetResult() on the function Initialize from the class DbInitializer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/34549714). I commented out that code and now everything is working fine.
